        "question": "What are the time limits for task completion?",
        "answer": "It depends on many factors. In general, don't wait until the last day before deadline, since you will probably be not the only client. Contact me as soon as you feel the need for help so that I at least know about your task, even if you will decide to do it yourself."
    },
    {
        "question": "How are prices calculated?",
        "answer": "Depends on complexity, time limits and how many other clients I have at the moment. Send me the topic (ideally with the task itself) and I will tell you the price."
    },
    {
        "question": "What payment methods are accepted?",
        "answer": "Either cash or crypto. You can send USDT, TON or Bitcoins through Telegram wallet. Otherwise someone of my collegues will come for cash, ideally on Kipsala but some other places are also possible. I don't accept bank transfers, PayPal or other methods due to anonymity reasons. If you have troubles with the wallet, write me and I'll try to help."
